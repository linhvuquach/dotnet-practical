# Deadlocks

Avoiding deadlocks in asynchronous and concurrent programming is crucial for ensuring that your applications run smoothly without getting stuck waiting for resources.

## Strategies for avoiding Deadlock

1. Use Asynchronous programming approriately

- Use **async** and **await** to avoid blocking threads.
- Avoid using **.Wait()** or **.Result** on tasks in an asynchronous context, as these can cause deadlocks, especially in UI applications.

2. Avoid nested locks

Nested locks can lead to circular dependencies. Ensure that you do not acquire more than one lock at a time, if possible.

3. Use timeout for locks

Use Monitor.TryEnter or Mutex.WaitOne with a timeout to avoid waiting indefinitely for a lock.

4. Design lock hierachy

If multiple locks are necessary, establish a **strict order** in which locks are acquired to prevent circular dependencies.
