## Parallel programming

Parallel programming in C# involves **dividing** a task into **multiple smaller tasks** that can **run simultaneously** on multiple processors or cores. The **System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel** class is a key component in C# for implementing parallelism.

## Concurrency

Concurrency involves multiple threads making progress within a single application. The primary goal is to handle multiple tasks at the same time, such as I/O operations, user interactions, etc.
